These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://www.adventofcode.com/2024/) implemented in our beloved programming language, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Usage

**Step 1:** Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

**Step 2:** Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iamhrigved/advent-of-code-2024.git ~/advent-of-code-2024
```

**Step 3:** cd into the repository

```sh
cd ~/advent-of-code-2024
```

And... you are done!

## Usage

All binaries are named as day{1-25}. To run one of the binaries, run

```sh
cargo run day{X}
```

where {X} is a number between 1 to 25.

Have fun :)
