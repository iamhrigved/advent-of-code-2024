These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://www.adventofcode.com/2024/) implemented in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.

## Setup

**Step 1:** Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

**Step 2:** Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iamhrigved/advent-of-code-2024.git ~/advent-of-code-2024
```

**Step 3:** cd into the repository

```sh
cd ~/advent-of-code-2024
```

And... you are done!

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> All inputs have been removed because I didn't read the instructions [here](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about).

All binaries are named as day{1-25}. To run one of the binaries, run

```sh
cargo run --bin day{X} # replace {X} with a number between 1 to 25
```

You can also test the functionality of a specific binary by running

```sh
cargo test --bin day{X}
```

Have fun!

## About me

I am just a noob trying to learn Rust and I will be updating these solutions as I learn more and more about this beautiful programming language ;)
